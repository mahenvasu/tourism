    <br>
    <p>Delft island is an Island in the Palk Strait, northern Sri Lanka. This island is named as Delft in the Admiralty Chart unlike the other islands, whose names are Tamil. The island's area is 50 km² and it is roughly oval-shaped. Its length is 8 km and its maximum width about 6 km. Delft Islands flat grounds adds to the beauty of its breath taking views.<br><br>The remotest of Sri Lanka's inhabited islands is Delft, which is situated in the Gulf of Mannar to the north-northwest of mainland Sri Lanka and to the south-southwest of Jaffna peninsula. Delft Island is a Divisional Secretariat of Jaffna District in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka.<br><br>

Besides the natural beauty of the sparsely populated island and some ruins of a fortress buildings, there are few attractions for travellers - but they are somewhat strange ones, namely first and foremost Sri Lanka's only herds of feral horses, descendants of Arabian stallions once breeded here for horse trade with India; secondly an imposing specimen of a Baobab tree, a typical species of subsaharan Africa, which is a rare sight in Sri Lanka. All landmarks of Delft Island – the buildings, the animals and the tree - are legacies of European colonial history.<br><br>

The Dutch city name "Delft" is the common Sinhalese designation of the island, although the Sinhala language otherwise avoids the articulation of three consonants and does not use the ending "lft". Of course, there is a traditional Tamil name as well, "Neduntivu", also spelt "Neduntheevu", which translates to "long island" or "large island". But Sri Lankans of all ethnicities still use - or at least understand - the word "Delft". Even on renowned international nautical maps, e.g, the Admiralty Charts issued by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, the island is cartographed as "Delft".<br><br>

Not surprisingly, this strange name for a tropical island is of colonial origin. After the Dutch conquered Jaffna from the Portuguese in the mid 17th century, Rijckloff van Goens, their Governor of Zeylan, gave names of Dutch cities to all eight major islands of the archipelago in the Palk Strait just to the west of Jaffna peninsula, e.g. "Rotterdam" for the islet Analaitivu, which is the smallest of those eight. In the course of time, most Dutch city names of their islands have been forgotten by Sri Lankans - except from "Delft" for the most distant one.
